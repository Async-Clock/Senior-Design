# Dashboards

This directory is for hosting all the Grafana dashboards created for the project. 

## Requirements

Some of the models require the [agenty flowcharting plugin](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/agenty-flowcharting-panel/) for Grafana.

## Usage

These models were edited by [grafana-pull](https://github.com/Async-Clock/Senior-Design/tree/main/Scripts/Grafana-Pull), a tool made for pulling dashboard JSON models from Grafana servers. Because of that, they are ready to be added to Grafana via the API using our [grafana-api script](https://github.com/Async-Clock/Senior-Design/tree/main/Scripts/Grafana-API).
